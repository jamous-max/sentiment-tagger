# Simple Sentiment Analyzer

## Overview
Python script for analyzing short text posts and generating a basic sentiment report.  
It reads text input, checks each post against positive and negative word lists, and outputs a JSON sentiment report.

## What this project does
- Reads text posts from an input file  
- Cleans text (lowercases and removes empty lines)  
- Analyzes sentiment using keyword matching  
- Classifies each post as positive, negative, or neutral  
- Saves results into a JSON report file  

## Project Structure
- `input_posts.txt` — raw text posts input file  
- `sentiment_report.json` — generated sentiment analysis report  
- `main.py` — main analysis script  

## What this shows
- Practical text processing for marketing-style content  
- Simple sentiment analysis logic  
- Use of lists, loops, and dictionaries  
- JSON file generation  
- Clean project structure  

## How to run the project
1. Make sure Python is installed  
2. Clone or download the repository  
3. Add text lines into `input_posts.txt`  
4. Run the script:
5. Check `sentiment_report.json` for results  

## Notes
This is a small learning project for practicing text processing, automation, and report generation.
